Example Use
-----------

    # Kerberos server (kdc and kadmin)
    class {'kerberos':
      master => true,
      realm => 'EXAMPLE.ORG',
      kdc_database_password => 'secret',
    }

    # kerberos client
    class {'kerberos':
      client            => true,
      realm             => 'EXAMPLE.ORG',
      domain_realm      => { '.example.org' => 'EXAMPLE.ORG', },
      kdcs              => ['cellserver.example.org'],
      admin_server      => 'cellserver.example.org',
      allow_weak_crypto => true,
    }

Hiera Usage
-----------

Define all the main class parameters you'd like to change like this:

kerberos::realm: 'EXAMPLE.ORG'
kerberos::kdcs:
  - 'cellserver.example.org'

Forget about client => true. Just include or hiera_include() any of the
following classes (perhaps not master and slave on the same box...):

kerberos::client
kerberos::kdc::master
kerberos::kdc::slave

It is best to store passwords in Hiera; that way, you can have a set of test
credentials, and a different set of credentials for production servers.  For
example, in debug environments, you might use realmone.local and realmtwo.local
instead of realmone.com and realmtwo.com, which of course would cause puppet
to pull your configuration from different .yaml files.  Debug configuration
could be checked in to the repository, and production values could be stored
in a more secure location.


  kdc1.realmone.com.yaml:
  ---
  kerberos_principals:
    user1:
      password: secretsecret


  kdc2.realmtwo.com.yaml:
  ---
  kerberos_principals:
    user2:
      password: p4ssw0rd!


  production.yaml:
  ---
  kerberos::kdc_database_password: verylongsecurerandomlyproducedpassword

  trusted_realms:
    realms:
      - REALMONE.COM
      - REALMTWO.COM
    password: differentverylongsecurerandomlyproducedpassword
